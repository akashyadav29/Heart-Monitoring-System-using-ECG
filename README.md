# Heart-Monitoring-System-using-ECG

The IoT-based heart monitoring system using ECG is designed to monitor and track vital signs related to the cardiovascular system, specifically focusing on heart rate, oxygen saturation, and body temperature. The project utilizes various components, including the NodeMCU ESP8266, ECG sensor, SpO2 sensor, temperature sensor, OLED display, and buzzer, to achieve its objectives.

The system continuously collects data from the ECG sensor, which measures the electrical activity of the heart, enabling the calculation of heart rate and detection of irregular heart rhythms. The SpO2 sensor measures the oxygen saturation level in the blood, providing insights into respiratory health. The temperature sensor monitors body temperature, an important parameter for assessing overall well-being.
